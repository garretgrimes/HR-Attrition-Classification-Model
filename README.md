# HR-Attrition-Classification-Model

In this project, I conducted an analysis on an HR attrition dataset to identify the most important factors for employee retention. With so many employers trying to identify these factors today, I aimed to use a number of them and analyze the attrition variable across the rest of the features in the dataset.

This analysis seeks to answer important questions, such as whether job satisfaction matters more than total pay, what the most important predictors of employee attrition are, and whether a model can be developed to predict whether or not employees will remain in their jobs. Additionally, I explored some of the limitations of the analysis.

To tackle these questions, I evaluated multiple different machine learning algorithms. I started by exploring decision tree algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, as well as logistic regression and a neural network. As the target variable was highly unbalanced, I also implemented SMOTE, a popular technique for dealing with imbalanced datasets, during the evaluation of these algorithms.

Through this process, I was able to identify which machine learning algorithm performed best in predicting employee attrition based on the dataset's features. The results of this analysis can help employers understand which factors are most important to retain their talent and positively impact their ability to deliver value to their customers.
